    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years. A full-grown adult camel stands 1.85 m at the shoulder and 2.15 m at the hump.
        Camels can run at up to 65 km/h in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h. Bactrian camels weigh 300 to 1,000 kg and dromedaries
        300 to 600 kg. The widening toes on a camel's hoof provide supplemental grip for varying soil sediments.
        The male dromedary camel has an organ called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert
        dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth. Camels mate by having both
        male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating
        session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
